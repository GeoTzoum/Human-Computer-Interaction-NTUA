### MediTracker ðŸ’Š
Take a chill pill, you won't forget the other ones.

The Meditracker app makes sure you don't miss a dose of medication
or vitamins. The ability to create different user profiles allows the
monitoring medication intake and other loved ones. It is handy for
all ages as it has sound notifications, possibility to personalize it
name of each drug, drug recognition via camera and large, clearly visible
font.
